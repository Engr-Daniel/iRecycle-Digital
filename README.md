# Data Analysis for Environmental Reports and Personalized Customer Impact

This repository contains data analysis workflows designed to address key business questions, generate comprehensive environmental reports, and provide personalized impact reports for each customer. These analyses focus on waste management, recycling data, and the environmental impact of various materials such as PET plastics, aluminum cans, PP plastics, glass bottles, and cardboard paper.

## Project Overview

### Objectives:
1. **Answer Business Questions**: 
   - How much waste is generated by different materials?
   - What are the recycling rates, and how can they be improved?
   - What is the environmental impact of recycling versus sending waste to landfills?

2. **Generate Environmental Reports**: 
   - Quantify the carbon footprint reduction for each recycled material.
   - Estimate landfill reduction and resource conservation achieved through recycling.

3. **Personalized Impact Reports**: 
   - Provide individual customers with detailed insights into their waste contributions, recycling efforts, and environmental impact.


## Data Sources
The analysis is based on data collected from various customer input forms, including:
- **Waste Owner Registration Form**: Details on materials generated, estimated quantities, collection frequency, and sector (residential, commercial, etc.).
- **Collection Recording Form**: Information on collected waste material, quantity, and customer incentives.



## Analytical Process

### 1. **Data Cleaning and Preparation**
   - Data was cleaned and standardized, correcting inconsistent spellings (e.g., "King pere kule" to "King perekule") and addressing missing or inaccurate values.
   - Categorical data, such as material types (PET, aluminum, glass, etc.), was labeled for easy analysis.

### 2. **Business Questions Addressed**
   - **Waste Generation Analysis**: 
     - We analyzed the total amount of waste generated by material type, location, and customer category.
     - Trends were identified for peak waste generation periods, and comparisons were made across sectors (residential vs. commercial).
   - **Recycling Efficiency**: 
     - We measured the quantity of waste recycled versus total waste generated, calculating the recycling rate for each material.
     - Suggestions were made for increasing collection efficiency in high-generation areas.
   
### 3. **Environmental Impact Report**
   - **Carbon Savings**:
     - We calculated the estimated carbon savings for each material recycled (e.g., 1 ton of recycled PET saves 1.5 tons of CO₂).
     - This data was used to estimate the total carbon reduction based on the amount of material recycled by customers.
   - **Landfill Reduction**:
     - Calculations were performed to determine the reduction in landfill space due to recycling, with separate estimates for PET, aluminum, glass, PP plastics, and cardboard.
     - The analysis highlighted the environmental benefits of recycling over traditional waste disposal.

### 4. **Personalized Impact Report**
   - Each customer received a personalized report with details on:
     - **Total Waste Contributed**: Breakdown of each material they generated.
     - **Recycling Contribution**: How much of their waste was recycled, along with their recycling rate.
     - **Environmental Impact**: Personalized metrics such as carbon savings, landfill reduction, and community impact (competition among recyclers).
   - These reports were generated automatically using data analytics tools and integrated into a user-friendly format.


## Data Visualizations

Several visualizations were used to present the insights:
- **Bar Charts**: To compare the total waste generated by material and sector.
- **Heat Maps**: Highlighting geographical areas with high waste generation.
- **Line Graphs**: Tracking recycling trends over time.


## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- **Total Waste Generated** (Kg)
- **Recycling Rate** (%)
- **Carbon Footprint Reduction** (tons of CO₂ saved)
- **Landfill Reduction** (cubic meters saved)
- **Customer Participation** (number of collections, frequency)



## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the power of data-driven analysis in optimizing waste management and recycling processes. By leveraging customer data and environmental metrics, we can drive sustainability efforts and provide actionable insights for businesses and individuals alike.
